# Unveiling Cosmic Secrets: Exploring the Kepler Dataset with PCA, LDA, and QDA

## Project Overview

This project dives deep into the rich data collected by the Kepler Space Telescope, aiming to uncover hidden patterns and extract meaningful insights using a combination of dimensionality reduction and classification techniques.

## Key Techniques

PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reduces dimensionality by identifying the most important features in the data, preserving variance and unveiling underlying structures.
LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation): Uncovers latent topics within text-based data, revealing thematic patterns and relationships.
QDA (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis): Classifies data points into distinct categories based on non-linear relationships, enabling a more nuanced understanding of potential groupings.
## Steps Involved

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
Obtained Kepler dataset from [source].
Cleaned and prepared data for analysis, addressing missing values and inconsistencies.
PCA:
Applied PCA to visualize high-dimensional data in lower dimensions.
Identified significant components and potential clusters.
LDA:
Extracted latent topics from text-based data (e.g., stellar descriptions, exoplanet properties).
Interpreted topics and explored relationships between them.
QDA:
Categorized data into groups based on non-linear relationships.
Evaluated classification accuracy and identified potential outliers.
